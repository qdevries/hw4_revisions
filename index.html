<h1>About Me</h1>

        <p> I'm Quin, as a first year masters at University of Michigan- Ann Arbor studying Information Science, 
        I am an aspiring UX Researcher who loves to solve human centered problems in creative, yet logical ways.
        Asking questions and piecing together solutions is what I love to do, especially within interdisciplinary 
        research. <br /> </p>
        <p> During my undergraduate at Iowa State University, it was a Design Heuristics workshop that inspired
        me to intertwine my research experiences, passion for design, psychology background, and multi-faceted
        problem-solving skills into a career; however, at the time, I was not sure how.
        Post graduation, as a Marketing and Sales Associate, I accidently stumbled upon UX and from that moment 
        I knew this is the career I was searching for. <br /> </p>
        <p> Thank you for your patience, I am releasing pages and content frequently. <br /> </p>
