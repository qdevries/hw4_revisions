        <p>The Challenge
            The Shapiro Undergraduate Library has a state of the art data visualization tool called the Viz HUB. 
            This is the first of its kind in the library, while the rest of the devices exist on the engineering campus. 
            Per the design brief it was placed there because “frankly, there was space there.” According to library metrics and 
            observational data, the Viz HUB is being reserved, but is only being used as a silent or small group study space
            and the technology itself is not being used. We were tasked to research the problem and offer recommendations to 
            improve utilization of the Viz HUB.</p>
